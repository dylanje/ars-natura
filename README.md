# Ars Natura - an Ars Nouveau addon

The original intent for Ars Natura was to provide better biome control for skyblock modpacks.

This is achieved through adding new rituals to conjure "biomes" that change the biome.

## Rituals Added

The rituals loosely follow the categories of Biomes on [minecraft.wiki](https://minecraft.wiki/w/Biome)

### Oceans
- Conjure Biome: Oceans
- Conjure Biome: Deep Oceans
- Conjure Biome: Mushroom Fields

### Highlands
- Conjure Biome: Mountain Slopes
- Conjure Biome: Mountain Peaks
- Conjure Biome: Windswept Hills

### Woodlands
- Conjure Biome: Forest
- Conjure Biome: Taiga
- Conjure Biome: Old Growth Taiga
- Conjure Biome: Old Growth Taiga 
- Conjure Biome: Wetland
- Conjure Biome: Flatland

Each ritual  supports augmenting with Source Gems to increase the radius as expected, but also has varying augments to define the biome
